<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class=subtitle>  </p>
<section>
    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Bailey Wickham</b>, I grew up in Oregon and I am now a student at Cal Poly studying Mathematics and Computer Science, minoring in Chinese. I enjoy travel, learning, and music. </p>

    <p>I am currently looking for an internship in Software or Hardware in China.</p>

    <p>I like linux, golang, python, vim, docker and experimenting with anything new. I enjoy backend programming, systems programming, networking, and devops. </p>

    <p>Math is also really cool. I am currently studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory">Ring Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category theory</a> both in class and on my own. This summer I will be studying Algebraic Geometry and Category Theory through an undergraduate reseach program under Dr. Eric Brussel.

    <p> See my resume <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileywickham/baileywickham.github.io/master/r.pdf">here</a> and my code <a href="https://github.com/baileywickham">here</a>.</p>
