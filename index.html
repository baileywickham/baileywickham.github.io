<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class=subtitle>  </p>
<section>
    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Bailey Wickham</b>, I graduated with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Cal Poly.
         I love travel, adventure, music, and learning. </p>

    <p>My goal is to (eventually) pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or Mathematics.

    <p>
        I like playing with linux, golang, python, racket, vim/emacs, docker and experimenting with anything new. 
        I have a bunch of random personal projects on my <a href="https://github.com/baileywickham">github</a>.
        Most of my professional experience is in backend and frontend development, but I have some experience in systems programming and DevOps.
    </p>
    <p>
        I previously worked for Amazon on the IPX team. I also wrote software for satellites through the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab 
        (<a href="https://polysat.org">PolySat</a>). 
        I was the Project Manager for the 3U CubeSat ExoCube II during it's build and testing phase, which launched on Virgin Orbit Q1 2021.
    </p>

    <p> 
        I am also interested in Mathematics, my current interests are in Algebraic Geometry. 
        I've also studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category theory</a> 
        for <a href="https://cat.baileywickham.com/">my senior project</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At Cal Poly I studied non-commutative algebra (central simple algebras, generalized quaternions) and category theory through the Frost undergraduate research
        program under Dr. Eric Brussel. I'm interested in specializing in Algebraic Geometry for my possible Ph.D.
