<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class=subtitle>  </p>
<section>
    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Bailey Wickham</b>, I grew up in Oregon and I am now a student at Cal Poly studying Mathematics and Computer Science, minoring in Chinese. I enjoy travel, adventure, music, and above all learning. </p>

    <p>I think I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D in Computer Science or Mathematics following my undergrad.

    </p>

    <p>I like linux, golang, python, vim, docker and experimenting with anything new. I enjoy backend and systems programming, networking (QUIC), and devops.</p>

    <p>I currently write software for satellites through the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (<a href="https://polysat.org">PolySat</a>). I was the Project Manager for ExoCube II during it's build and testing phase, which is planned to launch on Virgin Orbit Q4 2020.

    <p>I am also intested in Mathematics. I am currently studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">Field Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category theory</a> both in class and through self study. This summer I am studying Algebraic Geometry and Category Theory through the Frost undergraduate reseach program under Dr. Eric Brussel.

    <p> See my resume <a href="https://github.com/baileywickham/baileywickham.github.io/raw/master/r.pdf">here</a> and my code <a href="https://github.com/baileywickham">here</a>.
