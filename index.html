<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class=subtitle>  </p>
<section>
    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Bailey Wickham</b>, I am a student at Cal Poly studying Mathematics and Computer Science, minoring in Chinese. I enjoy travel, adventure, music, and above all learning. </p>

    <p>My goal is to (eventually) pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or Mathematics following my undergrad.

    </p>

    <p>I like playing with linux, golang, python, racket, vim/emacs, docker and experimenting with anything new. Most of my experience is in backend, systems programming, and DevOps.

    <p>I currently work for Amazon on the IPX team.</p>

    <p>I previously wrote software for satellites through the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (<a href="https://polysat.org">PolySat</a>). I was the Project Manager for the 3U CubeSat ExoCube II during it's build and testing phase, which launched on Virgin Orbit Q1 2021.

    <p>I am also interested in Mathematics. I am currently studying
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a> for <a href="https://cat.baileywickham.com/">my senior project</a>. I want to focus on algebraic geometry, perfectoid spaces, or infinity categories.
        Last summer I studied non-commutative algebra (central simple algebras, generalized quaternions) and category theory through the Frost undergraduate research
        program under Dr. Eric Brussel. I'm interested in specializing in algebraic geometry or category theory for my possible Ph.D.
