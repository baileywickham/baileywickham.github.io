<h1>Ph.D</h1>
<p class=subtitle>  </p>
<section>
    <p>I am currently interested in pursuing a Ph.D in either Pure Mathematics or Computer Science. I want to use this as a place to collect information about my experinece trying to figure out how to go about this at Cal Poly. Hopefully I can collect this and offer it publicly for anyone who comes after me.</p>

    <p> My interests mostly lie in Pure Mathematics, however the job prospects in this field seem more limiting to me than Computer Science. I am broadly interested in Algebra, possibly Algebraic Geometry or Category Theory.

    <p>I am also intested in Mathematics. I am currently studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">Field Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category theory</a> both in class and through self study. This summer I will be studying Algebraic Geometry and Category Theory through an undergraduate reseach program under Dr. Eric Brussel.
